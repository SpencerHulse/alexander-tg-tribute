        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Alexander III, son of King Philip II and Queen Olympias, was born in Pella, the capital of Macedonia, in 356 B.C.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As early as 12, Alexander stood out due to his courage by taming Bucephalus, an impressive stallion known for his aggressive temperament. The horse went on to be his companion in battle for most of his life.</p>
        <br />
        <p>He began to study under Aristotle a year later, where he gained an interest in subjects that included literature, science, and medicine. However, he later proved that he did not take on all of his teacher’s beliefs, especially how he treated non-Greeks throughout his life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>The Battle of Chaeronea</h3>
        <p>At the age of 16, Philip went off to battle, leaving Alexander in charge of Macedonia. Two years later, in 338, he finds a chance to prove himself at the Battle of Chaeronea, where he commands the army’s left wing to defeat the Sacred Band of Thebes, a military unit made up of male lovers and rumored to be unbeatable.</p>
        <br />
        <p>However, a year after the battle, Philip divorced Olympias, and after a heated argument, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus. Although they later reconciled, Alexander’s position as the heir of Macedonia weakened considerably.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>Becoming King of Macedonia</h3>
        <p>In 336 B.C. King Philip was assassinated, and despite his previously jeopardized position, Alexander became the ruler of Macedonia without opposition. Mainly, it was thanks to the troops, who viewed Alexander in high regard.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Once in power, Alexander proceeded to eliminate all those who might oppose him, including the princes of Lyncestis, who were believed to be behind the assassination of his father.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Alexander then marched south and recovered Thessaly before joining an assembly of the Greek League of Corinth. It was there that Alexander became the leader for an invasion of Asia that his father had planned before his death.</p>
        <br />
        <p>What followed were consecutive victories against the Greek powers who wanted independence, including the quelling of a rebellion that started after the rumor of his death. In just a few years, Alexander consolidated his power and turned his attention elsewhere.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>The Battle of the Granicus</h3>
        <p>Alexander set his sights on Persia early on, and with everything settled in Macedonia, he set off with his army. More than that, he needed the wealth that conquering Persia could bring him, not only to support the army left by Philip but to repay a debt.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Fortunately, Alexander’s confidence stemmed from a vulnerability exposed in the Persian army. All he needed was a powerful cavalry, and he had that and more, marching with a balanced troop prepared for any situation. In fact, Alexander traveled with more than soldiers, including engineers, scientists, court officials, and many other skilled people, to keep going for as long as he needed to. He was prepared.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Granicus River was where Alexander engaged his first Persian army, and it was the location that marked his first victory against King Darius III.</p>
        <br />
        <p> The Persian army almost claimed his head during the battle, luring Alexander across the river to engage in a brutal melee. But he came out victorious and opened the door to Asia Minor.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>The Battle of Issus</h3>
        <p>Alexander overcame many obstacles and expanded his influence after the Battle at the Granicus, conquering western Asia Minor. However, it wasn’t until 333 B.C., near the town of Issus in southern Turkey, that he faced his second battle against King Darius III, who led the troops personally.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Battle of Issus saw Alexander’s troops greatly outnumbered, but their experience and determination pulled them through. It left Darius no choice but to flee with his remaining troops, even leaving his family behind. Once more, Alexander clutched victory, proving his military prowess.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>The Siege of Tyre</h3>
        <p>Alexander’s continued success caused Darius to reach out with a plea for peace, which he rejected. After his latest conquests of the towns of Byblos and Sidon, he set his sights on the island of Tyre. However, he found the fortified location difficult to topple without a proper navy.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The siege of Tyre went on, and despite his clever strategies, Alexander had no choice but to pause and build a powerful naval force to pierce the Tyrian defenses. Thus, he amassed a large fleet and finally found success, breaching the walls and capturing the city.</p>
        <br />
        <p>What followed was a brutal punishment for their defiance, with executions numbering in the thousands with the rest being sold into slavery. It was not the first time Alexander showed his ruthlessness, with slaves taken from many battles. However, it stands as another example of his ability to show both chivalry and brutality based on the situation.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>Alexandria</h3>
        <p>Alexander set his sights on Egypt, setting out after rejecting another one of Darius’s peace offers. But things did not go smoothly, with another siege holding him up at Gaza for several weeks. Only then did he reach Egypt, where he established Alexandria, a city that still stands today.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>Becoming King of Persia</h3>
        <p>In the same year as the founding of Alexandria, the third and final battle between Alexander and Darius took place at Gaugamela. It was a massive battle with severe losses on both sides, but it ended in the same way as their previous battles, with Alexander’s eventual victory.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Upon his defeat, Darius fled, but his own troops assassinated him. With Darius no more, Alexander stepped forward and proclaimed himself as the king of Persia. Another Persian leader, Bessus, tried to make a claim as well, but Alexander did not let it stand, relentlessly pursuing him. Eventually, Bessus’s troops surrendered him. After his mutilation and execution, Alexander took full control of Persia.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="major-event">
        <h3>Proskynesis and Paranoia</h3>
        <p>After becoming King of Persia, Alexander began to take on many of the customs, one of which was proskynesis. The particular custom involved bowing down and kissing someone’s hand, depending on their rank.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The custom played into Alexander’s attempt to be seen as a deity. Although the word deity had been thrown around before in regards to Alexander, his troops reacted negatively to the changes in him, and they refused to practice the act. Some even plotted to kill him.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Alexander’s paranoia rose, perhaps rightly so, and it eventually pushed him to order the death of Parmenion, one of his best generals and a man who had served both him and his father. Parmenion’s family was not spared, either, with his son soon being executed after an accusation of treason.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The act of eliminating Paremnion and those who could be seen as his father’s men caused some discontent and horror, but it allowed Alexander to promote his own people, ultimately strengthening his position.</p>
