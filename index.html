      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>Alexander III, son of King Philip II and Queen Olympias, was born in Pella, the capital of Macedonia, in 356 B.C.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As early as 12, Alexander stood out due to his courage by taming Bucephalus, an impressive stallion known for his aggressive temperament. The horse went on to be his companion in battle for most of his life.</p>
      <br />
      <p>He began to study under Aristotle a year later, where he gained an interest in subjects that included literature, science, and medicine. However, he later proved that he did not take on all of his teacher's beliefs, especially how he treated non-Greeks throughout his life.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="major-e2" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Battle of Chaeronea</h3>
      <p>At the age of 16, Philip went off to battle, leaving Alexander in charge of Macedonia. Two years later, in 338, he finds a chance to prove himself at the Battle of Chaeronea, where he commands the army's left wing to defeat the Sacred Band of Thebes, a military unit made up of male lovers and rumored to be unbeatable.</p>
      <br />
      <p>However, a year after the battle, Philip divorced Olympias, and after a heated argument, Alexander and his mother fled to Epirus. Although they later reconciled, Alexander's position as the heir of Macedonia weakened considerably.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="major-e3" class="major-event">
      <h3>Becoming King of Macedonia</h3>
      <p>In 336 B.C. King Philip was assassinated, and despite his previously jeopardized position, Alexander became the ruler of Macedonia without opposition. Mainly, it was thanks to the troops, who viewed Alexander in high regard.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Once in power, Alexander proceeded to eliminate all those who might oppose him, including the princes of Lyncestis, who were believed to be behind the assassination of his father.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Alexander then marched south and recovered Thessaly before joining an assembly of the Greek League of Corinth. It was there that Alexander became the leader for an invasion of Asia that his father had planned before his death.</p>
      <br />
      <p>What followed were consecutive victories against the Greek powers who wanted independence, including the quelling of a rebellion that started after the rumor of his death. In just a few years, Alexander consolidated his power and turned his attention elsewhere.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="major-e4" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Battle of the Granicus</h3>
      <p>Alexander set his sights on Persia early on, and with everything settled in Macedonia, he set off with his army. More than that, he needed the wealth that conquering Persia could bring him, not only to support the army left by Philip but to repay a debt.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Fortunately, Alexander's confidence stemmed from a vulnerability exposed in the Persian army. All he needed was a powerful cavalry, and he had that and more, marching with a balanced troop prepared for any situation. In fact, Alexander traveled with more than soldiers, including engineers, scientists, court officials, and many other skilled people, to keep going for as long as he needed to. He was prepared.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The Granicus River was where Alexander engaged his first Persian army, and it was the location that marked his first victory against King Darius III.</p>
      <br />
      <p> The Persian army almost claimed his head during the battle, luring Alexander across the river to engage in a brutal melee. But he came out victorious and opened the door to Asia Minor.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="major-e5" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Battle of Issus</h3>
      <p>Alexander overcame many obstacles and expanded his influence after the Battle at the Granicus, conquering western Asia Minor. However, it wasn't until 333 B.C., near the town of Issus in southern Turkey, that he faced his second battle against King Darius III, who led the troops personally.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The Battle of Issus saw Alexander's troops greatly outnumbered, but their experience and determination pulled them through. It left Darius no choice but to flee with his remaining troops, even leaving his family behind. Once more, Alexander clutched victory, proving his military prowess.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e6" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Siege of Tyre</h3>
      <p>Alexander's continued success caused Darius to reach out with a plea for peace, which he rejected. After his latest conquests of the towns of Byblos and Sidon, he set his sights on the island of Tyre. However, he found the fortified location difficult to topple without a proper navy.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The siege of Tyre went on, and despite his clever strategies, Alexander had no choice but to pause and build a powerful naval force to pierce the Tyrian defenses. Thus, he amassed a large fleet and finally found success, breaching the walls and capturing the city.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The brutal punishment for their defiance followed, with executions numbering in the thousands and the rest being sold into slavery. It was not the first time Alexander showed his ruthlessness, with slaves taken from many battles. However, it stands as another example of his ability to show both chivalry and brutality based on the situation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e7" class="major-event">
      <h3>Alexandria</h3>
      <p>Alexander set his sights on Egypt, setting out after rejecting another one of Darius's peace offers. But things did not go smoothly, with another siege holding him up at Gaza for several weeks. Only then did he reach Egypt, where he established Alexandria, a city that still stands today.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e8" class="major-event">
      <h3>Becoming King of Persia</h3>
      <p>In the same year as the founding of Alexandria, the third and final battle between Alexander and Darius took place at Gaugamela. It was a massive battle with severe losses on both sides, but it ended in the same way as their previous battles, with Alexander's eventual victory.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Upon his defeat, Darius fled, but his own troops assassinated him. With Darius no more, Alexander stepped forward and proclaimed himself as the king of Persia. Another Persian leader, Bessus, tried to make a claim as well, but Alexander did not let it stand, relentlessly pursuing him. Eventually, Bessus's troops surrendered him. After his mutilation and execution, Alexander took full control of Persia.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e9" class="major-event">
      <h3>Proskynesis and Paranoia</h3>
      <p>After becoming King of Persia, Alexander began to take on many of the customs, one of which was proskynesis. The particular custom involved bowing down and kissing someone's hand, depending on their rank.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The custom played into Alexander's attempt to be seen as a deity. Although the word deity had been thrown around before in regards to Alexander, his troops reacted negatively to the changes in him, and they refused to practice the act. Some even plotted to kill him.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Alexander's paranoia rose, perhaps rightly so, and it eventually pushed him to order the death of Parmenion, one of his best generals and a man who had served both him and his father. Parmenion's family was not spared, either, with his son soon being executed after an accusation of treason.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The act of eliminating Paremnion and those who could be seen as his father's men caused some discontent and horror, but it allowed Alexander to promote his own people, ultimately strengthening his position.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e10" class="major-event">
      <h3>Alexander Kills Cleitus</h3>
      <p>Cleitus was another general and close friend of Alexander who died at Alexander's hand. Angry about the changes in Alexander, Cleitus hurled insults at him one night when drunk. Likely drunk as well, Alexander reacted violently, killing Cleitus with a spear, an act that caused him significant grief afterward.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e11" class="major-event">
      <h3>Marriage to Roxane</h3>
      <p>The Sogdians were a people who remained loyal to Bessus, even after his demise, and they made it difficult for Alexander to conquer Sogdia. They took refuge at the top of a rock and refused to give in, though that did not deter Alexander. It was atop the rock and within the ranks of the Sogdians that Alexander met his first wife, Roxane.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Alexander fell in love with Roxane at first sight, determined to marry her, regardless of her heritage. Afterward, she joined him on his journey, which soon led toward India.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e12" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Battle of Hydaspes River</h3>
      <p>Alexander's march into India was met with a mix of peace and battle, with some tribes surrendering and others refusing. However, it was not until 326 B.C. that he faced a true threat. The difficult battle came at the Hydaspes River against King Porus of Paurava.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The difference in experience between the troops stood out, giving Alexander's army the clear advantage. But the gap was closed by the presence of elephants, which were something the army had never faced before. Alexander still came out victorious, but the battle ended up being far more devastating than expected.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Another notable event to occur after the battle was the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus, who had accompanied Alexander since his youth. The cause of his death is unknown, but Alexander named a city after him in his memory.</p>
      <br />
      <p>After the victory against King Porus, Alexander's attention turned to the rest of India, with his desire to conquer still strong. His troops disagreed, though, convincing him to return to Persia.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e13" class="major-event">
      <h3>Marriages and Mutiny</h3>
      <p>Upon arriving at the city of Susa in Persia in 324 B.C., Alexander made the decision to unite the people of Persia and Macedonia through marriage. He did this by ordering many of his officers to marry Persian princesses. He even took several wives for himself during the mass wedding.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In response to Alexander's forced attempt at changing their culture, a mutiny occurred. However, Alexander responded by replacing Macedonian officers and troops with Persians. His strong response caused them to back down, and he eventually returned their titles and held a banquet to reconcile.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Later that year, Alexander lost his closest friend, Hephaestion, who some believe was his male lover. After his death, Alexander's sorrow led to extravagant mourning, which included a royal funeral.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="major-e14" class="major-event">
      <h3>The Death of Alexander the Great</h3>
      <p>By 323 B.C., Alexander had a massive empire under his rule, but he was not satisfied. He already started planning the next step in his plan to conquer the world, with his mind set toward Arabia. But those plans were not to be.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In June of 323 B.C., Alexander the Great died at the age of 32. The cause of his death is ultimately unknown, but with no successor in sight, his death left a power vacuum that resulted in a bloody battle for control that ended with the crumbling of the empire he created.</p>

    <h2>The Legacy of Alexander the Great</h2>
    <p>Alexander's life and accomplishments are still remembered today for a good reason. During his short rule, he conquered many lands, and he did it without losing a single battle. However, while his mastery of strategy and his exploits in war stand out, the lasting impact of his conquest goes beyond tales of victory.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Although Alexander's racial fusion attempts ultimately failed, many of the lands he conquered still retained Greek influence. And of the over 70 new cities he founded, several still stand as cultural centers today.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Alexander was an explorer, a military general that stands among the greatest to have ever lived, and someone who opened the doors to a vast land and a bright future. While his time was short and his death the downfall of his kingdom, his legacy lives on. His title of "the Great" is truly well deserved.</p>
