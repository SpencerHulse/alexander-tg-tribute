# alexander-tg-tribute

## Description
This is a tribute page to Alexander the Great.

The web page begins with a header that includes his name and a small tagline, as well as a navigation bar button that, upon click, brings in a navigation menu from the left side of the screeen. It is set up to take up 100% of the page on devices with widths smaller than 800px and then take 350px on widths larger than 800px. It is the only element on the page that uses js. It links to the major sections and events.

The next segment of the web page includes a picture and caption combo and a timeline, which share a container. These are stacked on top of one another on devices with widths below 800px, but the flex-container puts them side by side on widths above 800px.

Following that is a major event section with more detail on each segment of his life.

Lastly are a legacy section that speaks about some of the reasons he could be considered "the Great" and a footer with links to sites with more information.

## Potential Upgrades
These are some of my own thoughts for improving the page:

### Navigation
The navigation menu could have better organization, with subsections and main sections, mainly for the major events.

The navigation menu could also automatically close when clicking on the screen outside the meny when it only takes up 350px.

The navigation menu could be accessible anywhere on the page and not just at the top.
